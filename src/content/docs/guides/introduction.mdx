### What Is Vue
    Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like **view**) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a declarative, component-based framework for building complex UIs.
    
    Here is a minimal example:
```js
    import { createApp } from 'vue'

    createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      count: 0
    }
  }
    }).mount('#app')
```

```js
    <div id="app">
  <button @click="count++">
    Count is: {{ count }}
  </button>
 </div>
 ```

 **Result**
<CardGrid>
<Card title = "Count is: 0" size = "small"></Card>
</CardGrid>

The above example demonstrates the two core features of Vue:
- **Declarative Rendering:** Vue builds upon standard HTML by introducing a template syntax that enables declarative rendering of HTML output based on JavaScript state.
- **Rendering:** Vue automatically updates the DOM whenever JavaScript state changes, ensuring a seamless and efficient rendering process.

Some questions may arise, but don't worry – we'll cover all the details later in the documentation. For now, let's focus on understanding the basics of what Vue offers.

:::note[Prerequisites]
This documentation assumes you're familiar with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you're new to frontend development, it's recommended to learn the fundamentals first before diving into a framework. You can assess your knowledge with these resources on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. While experience with other frameworks can be helpful, it's not necessary to get started with Vue.
:::

### The Progressive Framework
Vue is a versatile framework and ecosystem that addresses most common frontend development needs. Given the web's diverse nature and varying project requirements, Vue is designed to be flexible and adaptable. Depending on your specific needs, you can use Vue in different ways:
- Enhancing static HTML without a build step
- Embedding as Web Components on any page
- Single-Page Application (SPA)
- Fullstack / Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Jamstack / Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Targeting desktop, mobile, WebGL, and even the terminal

New to these concepts? No worries! Our tutorial and guide are beginner-friendly and require only basic HTML and JavaScript knowledge. You don't need to be an expert to get started.

If you're an experienced developer looking to integrate Vue into your workflow or curious about the technical details, we'll dive deeper into these topics in [Ways of Using Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/ways-of-using-vue.html)

The way Vue works remains the same whether you're learning the basics or developing complex apps. This consistency benefits both beginners and experienced developers:
- **For Beginners:** The fundamentals you learn today will stay relevant as you take on more complex projects. 
- **For Experts:** Vue gives you the flexibility to choose the most efficient approach for your needs, without sacrificing productivity.

This is why we call Vue **"The Progressive Framework"** — it grows with you, fitting your skill level and project scope.

### Single-File Components
Most Vue projects that use build tools rely on Single-File Components, which are `*.vue` files that combine a component's:
- **Template (HTML):** defines the component's structure
- **Script (JavaScript):** handles the component's logic
- **Style (CSS):** controls the component's appearance

This format keeps related code organized in one file, making development more efficient. Here's an example of what an SFC looks like:
 ```vue
    <script>
     export default {
        data() {
            return {
            count: 0
                }
            }
        }
    </script>

    <template>
        <button @click="count++">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
    </template>

    <style scoped>
    button {
         font-weight: bold;
        }
    </style>
```
<br>
Single-File Components (SFCs) are a key feature of Vue and the recommended way to build Vue components when using a build setup.
You can learn about the [how and why of SFC](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc.html) in its dedicated section - but,
don't worry about the details just yet because Vue will handle the build tool configuration for you.

### Application Programming Interface (API) Styles
Vue components can be authored in two different API styles: **Options API** and **Composition API**.
#### Options API​
With Options API, we define a component's logic using an object of options such as: `data`, `methods`, and `mounted`. Properties defined by options are exposed on `this` inside functions, which points to the component instance:
```vue
    <script>
        export default {
        // Properties returned from data() become reactive state
        // and will be exposed on `this`.
        data() {
        return {
             count: 0
         }
        },

         // Methods are functions that mutate state and trigger updates.
        // They can be bound as event handlers in templates.
        methods: {
            increment() {
             this.count++
            }
        },

        // Lifecycle hooks are called at different stages
         // of a component's lifecycle.
        // This function will be called when the component is mounted.
            mounted() {
                 console.log(`The initial count is ${this.count}.`)
            }
        }
    </script>

    <template>
        <button @click="increment">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
    </template>
```

#### Composition API
With Composition API, you define a component's logic using imported API functions. In Single-File Components (SFCs), Composition API is typically used with [`<script setup>`](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html). 
The `setup` attribute enables Vue to perform compile-time optimizations, reducing the need for repetitive code (boilerplate). 
For example, imports and top-level variables/functions declared in `<script setup>` can be used directly in the template without additional setup.

Here is the same component, with the exact same template, but using Composition API and `<script setup>` instead:
```vue
    <script setup>
        import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'

        // reactive state
        const count = ref(0)

        // functions that mutate state and trigger updates
        function increment() {
            count.value++
        }

        // lifecycle hooks
        onMounted(() => {
            console.log(`The initial count is ${count.value}.`)
        })
    </script>

    <template>
        <button @click="increment">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
    </template>
```

#### Which to Choose
Both API styles are fully capable of covering common use cases. They are different interfaces powered by the exact same underlying system. 
In fact, the Options API is implemented on top of the Composition API! 
The fundamental concepts and knowledge about Vue are shared across the two styles.

Building on this shared foundation, the two APIs cater to different needs and preferences. The Options API is centered around the concept of a "component instance" (as seen in the example), 
which typically aligns better with a class-based mental model for users coming from object-oriented programming (OOP) backgrounds. 
It is also more beginner-friendly by abstracting away the reactivity details and enforcing code organization via option groups.

In contrast, the Composition API is centered around declaring reactive state variables directly in a function scope and composing state from multiple functions together to handle complexity.
It is more flexible, but requires an understanding of how reactivity works in Vue to be used effectively. 
In return, its flexibility enables more powerful patterns for organizing and reusing logic.

You can learn more about the comparison between the two styles and the potential benefits of Composition API in the [Composition API FAQ](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq.html)

If you are new to Vue, here's our general recommendation:

- For learning purposes:
    - Go with the style that looks easier to understand to you. Again, most of the core concepts are shared between the two styles. You can always pick up the other style later.

- For production use:

    - Go with Options API if you are not using build tools, or plan to use Vue primarily in low-complexity scenarios, e.g. progressive enhancement.

    - Go with Composition API + Single-File Components if you plan to build full applications with Vue.

You don't have to commit to only one style during the learning phase. Feel free to explore both! The rest of the documentation will provide code samples in both styles where applicable, 
and you can toggle between them at any time using the **API Preference switches** at the top of the left sidebar.
